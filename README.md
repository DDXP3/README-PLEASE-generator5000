# README GEN. 5000


## Description

        This project is a README file generater.
         - My motive for this project was to make a working README file generater so I wouldn't have to keep making them.
         - Making a README file could be very time consuming, so the reason I made this project was to take less time to make a README file.
         - This does indeed help reduce time on making README files.
         - I learned how to use nodejs, and write codes that would work for nodejs. I was very behind and have been watching old videos to help myself.

## Usage

        This can be used to make README files, I used it to make this README file, but I also modifyed it. For future use, this process will be quick and easy, and is super easy to modify.

For this Project, the three of us, were really running behind time. I have to give credits to Jason, as he does in fact know more codes then me, but with his guidences I could find myself learning things, and would take what I just learned and applied it myself before getting stuck on something else.

Working with Jason, is the one of the things keeping me in this bootcamp, it's really helpful to have someone who knows what they are doing. I'd like to have a someone else to help me, but I am a little busy with other things and only have time to sit down to do homework.
